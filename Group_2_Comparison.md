# Group N Comparison

## Methods

Brief description of the methods compared in this study and attribute each method to the respective group member.

1. **Method 1**: Harmonic Minimization Method: The harmonic minizmization method is a graph based learning algorithm for semi-supervised learning. It constructs a graph where each data point is a node, and the edges represent the similarity between them. The algorithm minimizes a cost function that encourages similar points to have similar labels while respecting the known labels, iteratively updating the labels of the unlabeled data points by solivng a harmonic function until convergence.  This method was contributed by Weston Mansier. [Weston's Report](wlm35/Weston_Mansier_Project_Report.md).

2. **Method 2**: Brief description of Method 2. This method was contributed by [Group Member 2 Name]. You can find more details in their individual report: [link to individual report 2].
3. **Method 3**: Brief description of Method 3. This method was contributed by [Group Member 3 Name]. You can find more details in their individual report: [link to individual report 3].
