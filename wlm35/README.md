All packages used in this project are included in wlm35/requirements.txt

The version of python that was used for my portion is Python 3.10.7

To replicate the results of my study:
- Navigate to csds440project-f24-2
- Type python wlm35/testing_new.py in the command line.

The algorithm will then start running on the three datasets, displaying the plots I used throughout and printint results on the optimal set of hyperparameters for each dataset
