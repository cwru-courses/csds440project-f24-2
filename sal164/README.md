I have all of my evaluation code in two notebooks :

- real_data_evaluation.ipynb

- synthetic_data_evaluation.ipynb

To run the different experiments, you can run the cells in the notebooks. 

To run the cells in the notebooks, you will need to pip install requirements.txt in your python environment.
