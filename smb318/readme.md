Replicating my experiments can be done in main.py. After importing the necessary packages, simply running main.py will replicate the plots in "comparison_plots" for the Australia and ionosphere datasets, respectively. Both datasets are retrieved using the fetch_ucirepo package, so no datasets need to be downloaded. The preprocessed_datasets() method will gather them, and return the features and labels for each dataset. From there, the combinations of classifiers for modifiedTriTraining are defined, and the compare_performance() method is run on each dataset, outputting the plots.
